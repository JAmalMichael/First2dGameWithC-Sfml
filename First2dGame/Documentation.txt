1. First off we create an asset folder containing the character files, animation and tiles.
1. Project planning and setup
2. Asset pipeline and data
folder layout, resolution,
3. Core engine skeleton
Implement main loop with fixed-timestep
Add Scene and state manager that can switch between scenes(Menu, Game, Pause, GameOver)
Implement resource manager(s) for textures, font, audio-load on demand
4. ECS basics & data model
Decide entity representation (integer ID)
Define component rules: Position, Velocity, Sprite, Collider, PlayerInput, Animation,Health, CameraFollow,TilemapLayer,etc)
Decide storage
Systems: RenderSystem, PhysicsSystem, InoutSystem, CollisonSystem, AnimationSyetem,CameraSystem, UISystem,AudioSyste, AISystem.
5. Tilemap and Level System
6. Input and Player controller
player movement: velocity + gravity + ground deection
coyote time, jump buffering, variable jump height for tighter feel.
Ground friction and air control tuning
7. Collision detection & response
8. Rendering and Camera
9. Animation and sprite handling
10. Enemies and AI
Patrol(moves back and forth), chase if player nearby), Idle, Attack, Dead.
Interaction: Enemy defeat by distinct moves
11. health, powerups & collectibles
12. Menu, pause, UI and Scene transitions
13. Audio
14. Polishing system
15. Testing and debugging
16. performance & Optimization
17. Controls
18. Build, packaging & release
Test release binaries for target OS
19. Development workflow
